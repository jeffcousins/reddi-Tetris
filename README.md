#reddi-Tetris
A personal JavaScript admissions project for Hack Reactor.

Think of it as a self-rewarding system of exploring Reddit after accomplishing strenuous work--but that work happens to be Tetris. The page pulls the top 100 posts from ***reddit.com/r/aww*** within the last 24 hours and will display one of them randomly every time you clear a line.

I couldn’t have done this without @chikeichan’s **Tetris** tutorial. Without it, I would have had no clue where to begin.

Functional programming, on-the-fly DOM wizardry, jQuery, API resourcing, etc. I learned a TON working on this and had a lot of fun!
